## This site is so wierd!

This is really an addendum to the last article (departure???), not its own thing.

But I asked Gemini to redesign my site to look like an old railway's departure board for funsies, and this is what it gave me.

I couldn't not publish it!

Here are some screenshots for posterity when I inevitably change it again!

## The extra bad version from like 30 minutes ago

I've realised I need to maintain a selection of images of old versions of this site. I may make a page dedicated to 
it at some point. For now here are some screenies from just a bit ago!
