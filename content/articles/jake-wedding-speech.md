## Speech

Thank you Buzz for the introduction, my condolences about the maid of honour situation!

But yes, let's turn our attention to the man of the hour, man of the day, my oldest friend Mr Jake Thorneycroft. 

I've known Jake for just over 20 years. I was a kid (of course) about 7, had just had to move schools and my assigned 
"buddy" the one meant to look after me, show me around, be my friend just wasn't interested. I don't blame him at all,
he was 7 too and there were footballs to kick. 

However, along comes Jake - no obligation, no task from a well-meaning adult, no reason and takes me in, under his wing
so to speak. It didn't sit right with him that the new kid didn't have any friends. This marks the first time of many 
that I saw the type of man he is, selfless and always looking out for people, even as a kid Jake was always looking out
for other people, doing anything he could to make sure they were okay. At this point I feel it necessary to thank his
mother Mickila, (thank you) - what a fantastic job you did to instil these values in your boy, and thank you for
putting such a wonderful example of what a man should be into this world, for us all to look up to. Young, or old. 

I could talk for hours about this man, and all the things he's done - but lucky for you all I'm gonna skip just a few 
years ahead and take a quick break from being soppy, and regale you with a short story about how Jake's easygoing nature
can sometimes just take over. 

So, it's year 6 at school, 2007 (I think), we're the big age of 11. Neither of us has managed to shake the other one off 
yet, often just the case of the blind following the blind if I'm honest with you. The SATs are in full swing, worst 
thing ever we thought at the time, such a stressful stressful time. We've got an exam that day, Jake and I are stood 
outside the classroom waiting patiently to be called in and eventually we are. I take my seat, ready to go. Jake on the
other hand seems to be, I don't know? Having a wander around? Actively circling the room like a dog spinning before it 
sits, which he eventually does. Now these are words paraphrased and de-lorry-driver-languaged from Jake himself, 
"I didn't have a flipping clue what I was looking at. It wasn't my exam." - never one to be deterred by any sort of 
obstacle, least of all being presented with an exam he knew he didn't have to do - he just cracks on as he does always 
in life. About halfway through the whole thing we get a knock on the door and Mrs WhateverHerNameWas comes in 
"Has anybody seen Jake Thorneycroft? He didn't come to his exam". Immune to any kind of embarrassment (a trait he
still has to this day, for better or worse), he proudly announces his presence, stands, and struts out of the room as if
it had been his plan all along. I don't know if he passed the exam, the one he was meant to take or the one he wasn't.
Nevertheless, as funny as I personally find it - I do think it represents his character quite well, any challenge he is 
presented with, expected or unexpected, easy or hard - he faces it head on without hesitation.

If I was asked to sum Jake up in 3 words, I would say it couldn't be done, then I would say, "Full of love". 
Because every action this man takes is spurred by his love whether he realises it or not; For his family he would do 
anything because he loves them, for his friends he would do anything because he loves them, and for that lonely little 
boy on the playground that he didn't even know - he did everything, because his love and compassion are endless.

Jake, you are my brother in every way except blood, and Chloe now you are my sister-in-law in every way except the law.
Your kids to me are my family too, my nieces as much as any blood relative. I hope you know that I, and I'm sure without
a shadow of a doubt that everybody else in this room would do anything they can for you and your family. If only to put
a fraction of the light into your lives that you put into ours. 

I love you both so, so much, I'm so glad you found each other. I can't think of anybody more deserving of their happy 
ending (and start) than you two. 

Please everybody raise your glass and drink to the continued health and happiness of (finally) Mr and Mrs Thorneycroft!

Last note, before I hand you back to your toastmaster general, if you would like some embarrassing stories about Jake please feel free to approach me privately later once I've had a few more drinks!
