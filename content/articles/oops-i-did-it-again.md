## A new site!

You'd never believe it's actually been a year (and a couple days shhhhh) since I last redid and republished my site!

On the last version of this site it even said, "Rebuild this site once a year" on the front page on a list of things I do!

See!

## I'm tired

This version is so much worse that the last version in terms of design.

## So tired

But it's built as a custom PHP SSG again! A new one!

You can read about the last time I did this [here](/articles/rewriting-this-site-in-php)

This time, there's no classes - it's just all one big messy build script in PHP. 
See [here](https://github.com/marccoup/marccoup.uk/blob/20be67ade84047728df23f81e4f55c9f6cef0aa6/build)
(it's messy!)

## So incredibly tired

I'll redesign this site again, but this time before the year is out. I like the SSG I wrote here for simplicity's sake.

Sorry, I'm not my usual witty self that you're all so used to â€” it's 1:16am, and I am just so tired.

Why do I do this to myself? I would love to know, please email me!

## I came back (Update)

Go read about the [railway version!](/articles/oops-i-did-it-again-again)
