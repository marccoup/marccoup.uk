Not doing a huge writeup on this one but I'll give you the cliff notes:

- I wanted to build a site to showcase my art
- I did that, with Laravel and [Filament](//filamentphp.com/) - because I wanted to
- I styled it very in a way that looked very similar to my previous site (which used [sakura.css](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/))
- I decided that it wouldn't be too hard to move the blog section to this site, and it would be nicer to manage everything in one place

That's about it!

As much as the static site stuff was nice because it was fun to build and free to host on GitHub Pages, I missed the simplicity of an admin panel
