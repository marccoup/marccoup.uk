## Prelude to the predule

This was originally going to be a whole article about how I redesigned my website off the back of taking Jack McDade's Radical Design Course (which is really great btw!), but I never actually finished writing it. I decided I would like to publish what I did write anyway, so below you will find what I did write - in it's incompleted glory!

You'll have noticed this site's design is not "Radical" by any means. That's because I undid my Radical Design and made it boring again (sorry Jack McDade) because I still wasn't happy with the site. Here are some screenshots of what it did look like however!

From here on out you'll be reading the original article!

Well... I learnt how to poorly rip off Jack McDade at least.
So should you:

## Prelude

So, last iteration of this site I dropped this banger of a post ([i _really_ need to learn design](/articles/i-really-need-to-learn-design)) which lamented the fact that I didn't have a competent designing bone in my body - and went over how all I wanted was a decent personal website.

Some time after that Jack McDade released his Radical Design Course, and **_boy_** after that intro video - I was hooked. I felt like this was exactly what I needed, something that could help me change the way I think about design, rather than a tutorial for some design software (which is all I'd ever looked at before). I'm paraphrasing here, but one of the most important things I learnt from the course was that you don't need a hard and fast set of requirements and a rigid process to design successfully - you need to kinda be "loosey goosey" with it, have **fun** with it, and learn to _enjoy_&nbsp; it.

Anyway, I'm not even done with the course (yet) - I've watched less than half the content so far. BUT even that has empowered me to create this site, which I know isn't some groundbreaking piece of design work, but is infinitely better than anything I've ever created before.

Now I do want to note that by trade I'm a backend developer, I'm not (by any stretch of the imagination) a frontend guy - so, the implementation may be a bit off, but I'm happy with it and that's what matters.

That said, I will be incrementally improving and updating the site as I pick up new tips and tricks, and just iterating on what I've got here already, until I think I've got something truly great (by my standards).

## Inspiration

### Colours & the stripes

All based on my riding goggles!

### Font(s)

### The "archive"

### Article view

It's just tailwind typography plugin with a couple tweaks. I was inspired by not having to style entry content myself.

## Statamic üòç

Not only did I (kinda) rip off Jack McDade's designs - by using Statamic I had him do most of the work too!
For real though, if you're making a custom blog - why aren't you using Statamic? There's absolutely no reason not to, literally cannot think of one.

## What's next

A breif summary:
- Understand & implement Bard
	- The content layout on here is still boring! and I **_know_**&nbsp; Bard can change that!
- Play with more colours
	- It has been pointed out to me that this site kinda looks like the German flag
